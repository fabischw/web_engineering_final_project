The CubeSat can also serve as a Personal Satellite for artists, musicians, advertisers, ,generics or individuals who wish to send items into space, or to transmit messages from space. If required, and for extra fees based on mission requirements, Interorbital Systems and its partners can offer design, development, training, and manufacturing services to individuals who do no possess the technical skills required to build the spacecraft. The first completed IOS CubeSat Kit 1.0 was launched into orbit by India's PSLV launch vehicle in 2019. This IOS CubeSat Kit, the KalamSAT V2, was assembled by Space Kidz India.",

CubeSat payloads and experiments are often new and unique, and project timelines are typically 9-24 months from inception to launch. Since launch opportunties are scheduled well in advance, it's critically important that a CubeSat project adhere to its schedules and stay on time and under budget. CubeSat missions still require considerable planning and many man-hours of work to maximize the chances for success. By employing as much standardization as possible you can concentrate on your project's mission-specific goals. By making use of as many off-the-shelf commercial and freely available tools and components in the construction of the nanosatellite, you'll save time and money. Through its comprehensive and flexible hardware and software design, Pumpkin's space-proven CubeSat Kit will help achieve success in your CubeSat mission. Now in its fourth generation and with over 150 delivered to customers since 2003, Pumpkin's CubeSat Kit is the defacto standard in the CubeSat universe, with compatible product offerings from Pumpkin and third parties.",
